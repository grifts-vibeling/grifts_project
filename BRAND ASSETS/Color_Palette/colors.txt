​## Official Grifts Color Palette: V1.0
​Here is the standardized palette, forged directly from your logo.
​🟣 Neon Pulse Purple
​#BE34D5
​Usage: The core purple. Ideal for primary gradients, bold accents, and high-energy elements that need to pop.
​🔵 Electric Cyan
​#21E8F2
​Usage: The vibrant blue highlight. Perfect for the "cool" end of gradients, call-to-action buttons, and futuristic UI elements.
​⚫ Void Black
​#101012
​Usage: Our primary background. It's a deep, near-black that makes the neon colors vibrate with energy. Much richer than pure #000000.
​⚪️ Starlight
​#F0F8FF
​Usage: The color of the magical sparkles. To be used sparingly for highlights, special effects, and clean, crisp text on dark backgrounds.
