## Official Grifts Typography Guide: V1.0
​Headline Font: Permanent Marker
​Usage: For all primary headings on the website (H1, H2), promotional banners, and anywhere we need to inject brand personality.
​Logotype: Custom Jagged
​Usage: The font within the logo itself is treated as a unique piece of art. We will not use it for regular text.
​Body Font: Lato
​Usage: For all paragraphs, descriptions, and smaller text. Lato is a clean, friendly, and highly readable sans-serif font that will pair perfectly with the boldness of Permanent Marker
